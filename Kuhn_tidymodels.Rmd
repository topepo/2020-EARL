# Modeling in R


.pull-left[
.font90[
* R has always had a rich set of modeling tools that it inherited from S. For example, the formula interface has made it simple to specify potentially complex model structures.   

* _R has cutting edge models_. Many researchers in various domains use R as their primary computing environment and their work often results in R packages.

* _It is easy to port or link to other applications_. R doesn't try to be everything to everyone. If you prefer models implemented in C, C++, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `python`, `stan`, or `Weka`, you can access these applications without leaving R. 
]
]

.pull-right[
However, there is a huge _consistency problem_. For example: 
* There are two primary methods for specifying what terms are in a model. Not all models have both. 
* 99% of model functions automatically generate dummy variables. 
* Sparse matrices can be used (unless the can't).
* Many package developers don't know much about the language and omit OOP and other core R components.

Two examples follow...

# Within-Package Inconsistency: `glmnet` Predictions

```{r glmnet-mod, include = FALSE}
sim_n <- 300

set.seed(1244)
dat <- data.frame(
  two_class = rep(letters[1:2], each = sim_n / 2),
  three_class = rep(letters[1:3], each = sim_n / 3),
  numeric = rnorm(sim_n) + 10,
  x1 = rnorm(sim_n),
  x2 = rnorm(sim_n),
  x3 = rnorm(sim_n),
  x4 = rnorm(sim_n)
)

x <- as.matrix(dat[,-(1:3)])
new_x <- head(x, 2)
rownames(new_x) <- paste0("sample_", 1:2)

reg_mod <-
  glmnet(x, y = dat$numeric, lambda = c(0.01, 0.1, 1))

two_class_mod <-
  glmnet(
    x,
    y = dat$two_class,
    nlambda = 3,
    family = "binomial", 
    lambda = c(0.01, 0.1, 1)
  )

three_class_mod <-
  glmnet(
    x,
    y = dat$three_class,
    nlambda = 3,
    family = "multinomial", 
    lambda = c(0.01, 0.1, 1)
  )

three_pred <- predict(three_class_mod, newx = new_x, type = "response")
three_pred <- apply(three_pred, 3, function(x) data.frame(x)) 
three_pred <- dplyr::bind_rows(three_pred)
three_pred <- dplyr::mutate(three_pred, lambda = rep(three_class_mod$lambda, each = 2))
three_pred <- tibble::as_tibble(three_pred)
```
 
The `glmnet` model can be used to fit regularized generalized linear models with a mixture of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> penalties. 

We'll look at what happens when we get predictions for a regression model (i.e. numeric _Y_) as well as classification models where _Y_ has two or three categorical values. 

The models shown below contain solutions for three regularization values ( $\lambda$ ). 

The predict method gives the results for all three at once (`r emojifont::emoji('+1')`). 


---

# Numeric `glmnet` Predictions

Predicting a numeric outcome for two new data points:


```{r glmnet-reg}
new_x

predict(reg_mod, newx = new_x)
```

A matrix result and we will assume that the $\lambda$ values are in the same order as what we gave to the model fit function.


---

# `glmnet` Class Predictions

Predicting an outcome with two classes:

```{r glmnet-2class}
predict(two_class_mod, newx = new_x, type = "class")
```

Not factors! That's different from what is required for the `y` argument. From `?glmnet`:

> For `family="binomial"` [`y`] should be either a factor with two levels, or a two-column matrix of counts or proportions


I'm guessing that this is because they want to keep the result a matrix (to be consistent). 


---

# `glmnet` Class Probabilities (Two Classes)

```{r glmnet-2class-prob}
predict(two_class_mod, newx = new_x, type = "response")
```

Okay, we get a matrix of the probability for the _second_ level of the outcome factor. 

To make this fit into most code, we can manually calculate the other probability. No biggie!


---

# `glmnet` Class Probabilities (Three Classes)

.pull-left[

```{r glmnet-3class-prob}
predict(three_class_mod, newx = new_x, 
        type = "response")
```

]
.pull-right[


`r emojifont::emoji('flushed')`

No more matrix results. 3D array and we get all of the probabilities back this time. 

_Am I working for `glmnet` or is it is working for me?_

Maybe a structure like this would work better:

```{r better-glmnet, echo = FALSE}
three_pred
```

]

# What We Need

Unless you are doing a simple one-off data analysis, the lack of consistency between, and sometimes within, R packages can be very frustrating. 

If we could agree on a set of common conventions for interfaces, return values, and other components, everyone's life would be easier. 

Once we agree on conventions, **two challenges** are: 

 * As of October 2020, there are over 16K R packages on CRAN. How do we "harmonize" these without breaking everything? 
 
 * How can we guide new R users (or people unfamiliar with R) in making good choices in their modeling packages?
 
These prospective and retrospective problems will be addressed in a minute.

# The Tidyverse

.pull-left[

The [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 


The principles of the tidyverse: 

1. Reuse existing data structures.
1. Compose simple functions with the pipe.
1. Embrace functional programming.
1. Design for humans.

This results in more specific conventions around interfaces, function naming, etc. For example: 



]
.pull-right[

```{r glue, echo = FALSE}
options(width = 50)
apropos("glue_")
options(width = 70)
```


There is also the notion of [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf): 

1. Each variable forms a column.
1. Each observation forms a row.
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Based on these ideas, we can create modeling packages that have predictable results and are a pleasure to use. 

] 

---

# Tidymodels 

`tidymodels` is a collection of modeling packages that live in the tidyverse and are designed in the same way. 

My goals for tidymodels are:

1. Encourage empirical validation and good methodology.

1. Smooth out diverse interfaces.

1. Build highly reusable infrastructure.

1. Enable a wider variety of methodologies.

The `tidymodels` packages address the *retrospective* and *prospective* issues. We are also developing a set of principles and templates to make *prospective* (new R packages) easy to create.

# Selected Modeling Packages 


* [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as `lm`, `nls`, or `t.test`, and turns them into tidy data frames.

* [`recipes`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. It can create model matrices that incorporate feature engineering, imputation, and other tools.

* [`rsample`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/) has infrastructure for _resampling_ data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated. 

* [`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/) gives us a unified modeling interface.

* [`tune`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/) has functions for grid search and sequential optimization of model parameters.

***Let's fit a linear regression model!***

With `parsnip`, we first create an object that specifies the _type_ of model and then the software _engine_ to do the fit.

# Linear regression specification `r I(hexes(c("parsnip")))`


.pull-left-a-lot[

```{r parsnip-lm-spec}

This says "Let's fit a model with a numeric outcome, and intercept, and slopes for each predictor."

* Other model types include `nearest_neighbors()`, `decision_tree()`, `rand_forest()`, `arima_reg()`, and so on.


The `set_engine()` function gives the details on _how_ it should be fit.

---

# Next steps

There are functions to plot the results, substitute the best parameters for the `tune()` placeholders, fit the final model, measure the test set performance, etc etc. 

These API's focus on harmonizing _Existing_ packages.

(If we still have time) Let's talk about designing better packages.



---

# Principles of Modeling Packages

.font90[
We have [a set of _guidelines_](https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/) for making good modeling packages. For example:

 * Separate the interface that the **modeler** uses from the code to do the computations. They serve two very different purposes. 

 * Have multiple interfaces (e.g. formula, x/y, etc). 

 * The _user-facing interface_ should use the most appropriate data structures for the data (as opposed to the computations). For example, factor outcomes versus 0/1 indicators and data frames versus matrices. 

 * `type = "prob"` for class probabilities `r emojifont::emoji('smile')`. 

 * Use S3 methods.  

 * The `predict` method should give standardized, predictable results. 

Rather than try to make methodologists into software developers, have tools to **help them create high quality modeling packages**. 

]

---

# Making better packages `r I(hexes(c("hardhat")))`

We have methods for creating all of the S3 scaffolding for modeling packages. 

You have some functions for creating a model fit; `hardhat` provides a package directory using best practices: 

```{r hardhat, eval = FALSE}
library(hardhat)

create_modeling_package("~/tmp/lantern", model = "torch_mlp")
```

There is a [video demo](https://canal.uned.es/video/5dd25b9f5578f275e407dd88) that shows how to create a package in 9 steps.
